Welcome to Church encoding.

## Instructions

Church encoding is a fundamental example of polymorphism usage and a basic example of tagless final encoding.

[Church encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding) is a means of representing data and operators in the lambda calculus. The Church numerals are a representation of the natural numbers using lambda notation. The method is named for Alonzo Church, who first encoded data in the lambda calculus this way.

* `ChurchBool` used to encode `Boolean`
